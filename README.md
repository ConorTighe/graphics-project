#   A 2D game for web browser

***

This is a game where the objective is to dodge the poisonous fish for as long as possible. every time a enemy
leaves the screen you score a point, but there speed improves and the number of enemys will increase as time goes on.

***

The libary I use in this game is called createJS which includes EaselJS and SoundJS. The sprites are taken from spritebase and the collision
detection I used was licenced by MIT as its more accurate and reliable for sprites then a box of if statements.

***

Game now requires internet as local library is no longer used, The url of createJS has replaced it. Github wont allow me to remove lib for some reason.
